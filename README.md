# toggleLayers
this is my first after effects scripts that can quickly toggle all layers of a type for you, this can help you check your base video without effects on adjustment layers for example

to add
toggle one framers
toggle nulls
toggle lights / cameras
toggle layers of a certain name
toggle layers with certain effects applied
